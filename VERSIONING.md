# Versioning

This project follows `MAJOR.MINOR` versioning using
[Github releases](https://github.com/mondeja/project-config-styles/releases).

- Major version changes imply breaking changes. Major version tags will be in
  the format `v[NUMBER]`.
- Minor version changes imply fixes for the major version. Minor version tags
  will be in the format `v[NUMBER].[NUMBER]`.

A project using these styles should ping to major version tags. Minor version
tags should only be pinned by a project if specific bugs solved in minor
releases are raised.

> New features can't be added in minor releases because all of them will
> imply breaking changes.
